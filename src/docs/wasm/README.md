# TeXmacs in the browser (branch `wip_wasm_vue`)

Goal: a WebAssembly build of TeXmacs which runs in a web page, on the Vue GUI
(Clay for the layout, MuPDF for the pixels) and SDL3, with the S7 Scheme
interpreter (merged from `wip_s7` of texmacs/texmacs, see [`../s7/`](../s7/README.md)).

## Starting point

- The branch starts from `wip_other_guis` (Vue, SDL and the other GUIs,
  2026-09-26) and merges the 38 commits of `wip_s7` over upstream
  `fa8da19dd0` ("resvg fix"). The two repositories have unrelated histories
  (two conversions of the SVN trunk; upstream's root is our `src/`), but
  `fa8da19dd0` has the very tree of our `1cc2c1435f` on `svn_sync`: the
  commits were replayed under `src/` on top of it (`git am --keep-cr
  --directory=src`, branch `s7_on_svn`) and merged with a real common base.
- S7 is the default interpreter (`--with-scheme=s7|guile`). Vue on S7 builds
  and passes the scripted tests (key-text, focus-windows, menus, dialogs,
  interactive, tools).

Guile 1.8 could not have come along: its garbage collector scans the C
stack for roots, which WebAssembly does not expose. S7 is a single C file
with a precise collector.

## What the browser does not allow

| desktop | in the browser |
|---|---|
| several windows (dialogs, tools, menus, tooltips) | one canvas |
| the loop owns the thread (`gui_start_loop`) | control goes back to the browser every frame |
| files anywhere, `$HOME/.TeXmacs` | a virtual file system; persistence in IndexedDB; the user's files through upload/download |
| plugins as processes (pipes), sockets, `system ()` | none: no fork, no pipes, no sockets |
| system file dialogs (SDL) | the browser's file input |
| the system clipboard, synchronously | the async Clipboard API (text), only on a user gesture |
| threads (SDL file dialog callbacks) | none unless SharedArrayBuffer and COOP/COEP headers |

## Plan

1. **Single-window mode, on the desktop first.** Every Vue window except the
   first becomes a *virtual window*: a rectangle composited into the host
   window, with its own Clay context as now. Dialogs and tools get a title
   bar (move, close); menus, tooltips and balloons are undecorated overlays.
   `plain_window` is the only place where windows are created, so the switch
   is there; the host's `process_redraw` draws the virtual windows on top, in
   z-order, and `process_event` routes the pointer by hit-testing them (as
   `popup_grab` already does for popups) and the keys to the focused one.
   Enabled by `TEXMACS_VUE_SINGLE_WINDOW` on the desktop, always in the
   browser. Tested with the scripted harness, which addresses windows by id
   and title and will keep doing so.
2. **No processes.** Plugins, sockets and external converters are disabled
   cleanly when unavailable (menus hidden, no crash), behind one flag.
3. **Toolchain and build.** Emscripten; SDL3 (port `-sUSE_SDL=3`), FreeType,
   zlib, libpng from the Emscripten ports; MuPDF built with `emmake` (it has
   an official WebAssembly build); SDL3_ttf with HarfBuzz; S7 as is. A
   dedicated build script rather than `configure`.
4. **Files.** `TeXmacs/` preloaded or fetched lazily (105 MB, of which fonts
   33 MB, progs 6 MB, doc 8 MB: the essentials first, the rest on demand);
   the home directory in IndexedDB (IDBFS); open and save through
   upload/download.
5. **The loop.** First with ASYNCIFY (`loop_wait` yields to the browser),
   then, if needed, the loop turned into a per-frame step
   (`emscripten_set_main_loop` or SDL's main callbacks).
6. **The page.** `index.html` with the canvas, the loading progress,
   `devicePixelRatio`, keyboard shortcuts kept from the browser, clipboard.

Phase 1 needs no Emscripten and is where most of the GUI work is.
